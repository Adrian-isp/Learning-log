# Learning-log
This repository is to document my learning journey
when it comes to software and computers. I started it on the
18th of February

#### 17th of February
I learned about hardware:
- how the **keyboard and mouse** work
- how the Motherboard connects to components on a computer
- the process of starting the operating system
- the UART communication protocol and a bit about how USB works

To say the least, I am much more amazed at the ingenuity behind
everyday systems we use and I realised the complexity behind
communication protocols within devices

#### 16th of February
- I found out how markdown files work and made the first READMEs

Finished with assembly:
- arithmetic instructions
- jump instructions

#### 15th of February
Started learning a bit about assembly:
- memory registers
- found out how to convert C into .s files

#### 8th of February
I learned about the what instruction sets are

I Discovered touch typing and began learning it

#### 7th of February 
I started looking at the **architecture of Computers** from the ground up:
- Adders and ALUs from logic gates
- Latches and memory registers
- (S)RAM and mutliplexers
- a simple 8-bit CPU
- the fetch-decode-execute stages

I followed the online series [Crash Course Computer Science](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&si=fPEFP-QnYMBBTocU)

#### 4th of February

I started being interested in understanding computers and the internet

Began learning the C programming language (having some prior knowledge of C++ from
school).
